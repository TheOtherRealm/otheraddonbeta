This is a Firefox add-on that serves two functions.  First, it adds buttons for common search engines so that you do not need to select from the drop down menu.  Second, if you highlight a word or phrase on a web page and press combination of keys, it will either open a Wikipedia or Wiktionary overlay.  The default keys are Ctrl+Shift+1 for Wikipedia, Ctrl+Shift+2 for Wiktionary and Ctrl+Shift+` to close the overlay.  These keys can be changed in the add on preferences.  Youâ€™d be surprised at how much time these simple tools can save you.
